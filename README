Cryptographically secure random generators for PHP.

As PHP core itself does not provide any kind of secure random generator,
extensions and other not portable means of obtaining entropy must be used.
This package provides a common interface \klg\random\RandomGenerator
for multiple secure random bit generators accessible from PHP.
It exposes the following implementations of it:
\klg\random\OpenSSLGenerator  which uses openssl_random_pseudo_bytes
\klg\random\McryptGenerator   which uses mcrypt_create_iv
\klg\random\EGDGenerator      which reads from Entropy Gathering Daemon
\klg\random\KernelGenerator   which reads from /dev/urandom
\klg\random\PHPNativeGenerator  which is slow but fully portable NRBG

Depending on availability of extensions \klg\random\RandomGeneratorFactory
will instantiate the best available implementation.

Additionally as a convenience wrapper a klg\random\SecureRandom class is
provided with few utility methods that allow generating random numbers and
cryptographic tokens (as for use in password reset procedure, etc) easily.

NOTE: Certain internal components are implemented as described in NIST
  SP 800-90A/B/C but they do NOT strictly conform to the standard nor
  they are intended to.  Standard requires extensive documentation and
  testing.
